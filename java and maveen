A Java project is a collection of Java source files, libraries, and configuration files used to develop a Java application.

Key Components- Java Source Files: 
1.java files containing Java code
2. Libraries: pre-written Java classes and JAR files used in the project
-3.Configuration Files: files like MANIFEST.MF or build.xml for project configuration

Types of Java Projects-  
1.Java Application: standalone Java application
2. Java Library: reusable Java code packaged as a JAR file
3. Java Web Application: Java application deployed on a web server

Java Project Structure- src/: Java source files
1. lib/: libraries and JAR files
2. bin/: compiled class files
3.build.xml: Ant build file (optional)

Creating a Java Project 
1. Create a new directory for the project
2. Add Java source files and libraries
3. Compile and run the project using javac and java commands

2. A Maven project is a Java project managed by Maven, a build automation tool.

Key Components- 
1.pom.xml: Project Object Model file, core of the Maven project
2. Java Source Files: .java files containing Java code
3. Dependencies: libraries and JAR files managed by Maven

Maven Project Structure- src/main/java/: Java source files
1.src/test/java/: test Java source files
2.src/main/resources/: resource files
3. pom.xml: Maven project configuration file

Creating a Maven Project
1. Create a new directory for the project
2. Run mvn archetype:generate to create a new Maven project
3. Configure pom.xml for project dependencies and settings

Maven Commands- mvn compile: compile project
1.mvn test: run tests
2.mvn package: package project into JAR/WAR
3.mvn install: install project in local repository
